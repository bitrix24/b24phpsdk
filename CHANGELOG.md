  - `PortalDomainNotFoundException` - thrown when Bitrix24 portal domain is not found or inaccessible
  - These exceptions allow developers to implement specific error handling logic based on the actual failure cause

### Changed

- Updated `darsyn/ip` dependency constraint to support version 6.x alongside versions 4.x and 5.x, [see details](https://github.com/bitrix24/b24phpsdk/issues/236)

    - All existing code remains fully compatible with version 6.x
    - API methods like `IP::factory()` continue to work without changes

### Fixed

- Fixed `MOVED_TIME` field in `DealItemResult` and `LeadItemResult` to return `CarbonImmutable` instead of `int`,
  [see details](https://github.com/bitrix24/b24phpsdk/issues/126):
    - Moved `MOVED_TIME` from integer casting block to datetime casting block in `AbstractCrmItem::__get()`
    - Field now correctly returns `CarbonImmutable` object matching the documented type

        - `MOVED_TIME` returns `CarbonImmutable` for both snake_case and camelCase variants
        - `DATE_CREATE`, `DATE_MODIFY`, `LAST_ACTIVITY_TIME` return `CarbonImmutable`
        - `MOVED_BY_ID` correctly returns `int`

        - `team`: changed from `array|null` to `array` (required field)
        - `trialFeatureEnabled`: changed from `bool|null` to `bool` (required field)
    - Preserved correct nullable types for notification thresholds: `notifyOnQueueOverflow`, `notifyOnTasksInProgressOverflow`, `notifyWhenEfficiencyDecreases` (int|null)
- Improved error handling during OAuth token refresh in `ApiClient::getNewAuthToken()`, [see details](https://github.com/bitrix24/b24phpsdk/issues/284):
    - Replaced generic error messages with specific exception types based on HTTP status codes and OAuth error codes
    - Added detailed error handling for different scenarios:
        - HTTP 400 with `invalid_grant` → throws `InvalidGrantException` (user re-authorization required)
        - HTTP 401 with `invalid_client` → throws `WrongClientException` (configuration issue)
        - HTTP 404 → throws `PortalDomainNotFoundException` (portal not found)
        - HTTP 5xx → throws `TransportException` with retry suggestion (server errors)
    - Enhanced error messages include both OAuth error code and description for better diagnostics
    - Developers can now distinguish between different failure causes and implement specific recovery logic
    - Added comprehensive unit tests covering all error scenarios
- Fixed `testFindByEmailWithVerifiedEmail` test in `ContactPersonRepositoryInterfaceTest` to properly mark email as verified,
  [see details](https://github.com/bitrix24/b24phpsdk/issues/316):
    - Added `markEmailAsVerified()` call for the first contact person after save and before flush
    - Ensures the test correctly validates the `findByEmail` method with `onlyVerified=true` flag

  [see details](https://github.com/bitrix24/b24phpsdk/issues/315):
    - Added `markMobilePhoneAsVerified()` call for the first contact person after save and before flush
    - Ensures the test correctly validates the `findByPhone` method with `onlyVerified=true` flag
- Fixed `testDelete` test in `ContactPersonRepositoryInterfaceTest` to call `flush()` after delete,
  [see details](https://github.com/bitrix24/b24phpsdk/issues/314):
    - Added `$flusher->flush()` call after `$contactPersonRepository->delete()` to persist changes
    - Ensures the test accurately reflects actual system behavior by persisting deletion before verifying the exception
