```

## 1.1.0 – 2024.09.25

### Added

- Added class `Bitrix24\SDK\Services\RemoteEventsFabric` for simple work with builtin Bitrix24 events. You can create
  Bitrix24 events from `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request` object. If event is not supported in SDK, fabric will
  create `Bitrix24\SDK\Core\Requests\Events\UnsupportedRemoteEvent` with generic interface
  `Bitrix24\SDK\Core\Contracts\Events\EventInterface` without typehints. Every event checked with valid
  `application_token` signature.
- Added method `Bitrix24\SDK\Services\ServiceBuilderFactory::createServiceBuilderFromWebhook` for simple work with
  webhook, see [add super-simple kick-off guide](https://github.com/bitrix24/b24phpsdk/issues/17).
- Added method `Bitrix24\SDK\Services\ServiceBuilderFactory::createServiceBuilderFromPlacementRequest` for simple work
  with placement request, see [add super-simple kick-off guide](https://github.com/bitrix24/b24phpsdk/issues/17).
- Added `Bitrix24\SDK\Core\Contracts\Events\EventsFabricInterface` for scope-based event fabrics.
- Added `Bitrix24\SDK\Core\Requests\Events\UnsupportedEvent` as a default event container object for unsupported in SDK
  Bitrix24 events.
- Added helpers for build local application in namespace `Bitrix24\SDK\Application\Local`:
    - `Local\Entity\LocalAppAuth`: auth data for local application. Contains: `AuthToken`, `domainUrl` and
      `applicationToken`.
    - `Local\Infrastructure\Filesystem\AppAuthFileStorage`: class for store LocalAppAuth in file
    - `Local\Repository\LocalAppAuthRepositoryInterface`: interface for LocalAppAuthRepository.
- Developer experience: added example `/examples/local-app-with-token-storage` for demonstrate all options for work with
  SDK and created local
  application skeleton.
- Developer experience: added example `/examples/webhook-error-handling` for demonstrate exceptions handling.
- Developer experience: added example `/examples/local-app-placement` for demonstrate work with placements.
- Added `WrongClientException` for handle errors with wrong application client configuration.
- Added `PaymentRequiredException` for handle errors with expired subscription.
- Added `WrongConfigurationException` for handle errors with wrong application infrastructure configuration.
- Added `WrongSecuritySignatureException` for handle errors
  with [wrong signature events](https://apidocs.bitrix24.com/api-reference/events/safe-event-handlers.html) with
  `application_token`.
- Added checks for empty string in args for constructor `Bitrix24\SDK\Core\Credentials\ApplicationProfile`
- Added class `Bitrix24\SDK\Application\Requests\Events\ApplicationLifeCycleEventsFabric`
- Documentation: added section [Basic necessary knowledge](docs/EN/README.md)
  in [SDK documentation](https://github.com/bitrix24/b24phpsdk/issues/35)
- Documentation: added section [Call unsupported methods](docs/EN/README.md)
  in [SDK documentation](https://github.com/bitrix24/b24phpsdk/issues/15)
- Developer experience: add issue template [Ship new SDK release](https://github.com/bitrix24/b24phpsdk/issues/42)

### Changed

- ❗️moved interface `EventInterface` from `Bitrix24\SDK\Application\Requests\Events` to
  `Bitrix24\SDK\Core\Contracts\Events`
- Changed order in expired_token case:
    - old: get new auth token → repeat api-call → emit event `Bitrix24\SDK\Events\AuthTokenRenewedEvent` for store token
    - new: get new auth token → emit event `Bitrix24\SDK\Events\AuthTokenRenewedEvent` for store token → repeat api-call
- Changed dependencies for `Bitrix24\SDK\Core\ApiClient` - added class `Bitrix24\SDK\Core\ApiLevelErrorHandler`
- Changed scope for properties `Bitrix24\SDK\Core\Credentials\ApplicationProfile` - mark as public
- Changed scope for properties `Bitrix24\SDK\Core\Credentials\AuthToken` - mark as public
- Changed example for work with webhook in [README.md](README.md) file and directory `/examples/webhook/`
- Changed example for work with local application in [README.md](README.md) file and directory
  `/examples/local-application/`

  see [wrong API-client and sdk version in headers](https://github.com/bitrix24/b24phpsdk/issues/13).
- Changed scope for property `core` in `Bitrix24\SDK\Services\AbstractServiceBuilder` - for better DX,
  see [Make core public in service builder](https://github.com/bitrix24/b24phpsdk/issues/26).
- Changed method name `Bitrix24\SDK\Services\ServiceBuilderFactory::initFromRequest` to
  `Bitrix24\SDK\Services\ServiceBuilderFactory::init`

### Fixed

- Fixed variable names in `Bitrix24\SDK\Services\ServiceBuilderFactory::initFromRequest`,
  see [wrong variable name](https://github.com/bitrix24/b24phpsdk/issues/30).
- Fixed some corner cases in `Bitrix24\SDK\Core\ApiLevelErrorHandler`
